## Jython

Current RF approach of running is to use Jython. This is the approach that is surely going away, as Jython supports only Python 2 which has been discontinued from April 2020. Also because of the age of Jython, it could easily have issues with newer JDKs.

Example simplified from https://github.com/Hi-Fi/robotframework-java-example.
